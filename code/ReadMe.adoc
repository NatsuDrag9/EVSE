= Project: Frequncy Controlled Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)

This project implements a possible solution that monitors the power systemâ€™s frequency using Arduino MKR100. The application allows the electric vehicle owner (the user) to either opt for automatic charging or manually select the charging current remotely from a web application. The current charging the vehicle is controlled by the duty cycle of PWM signal generated by the micro-controller based on the IEC61851 standard.

== Step 1: Download the code folder

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit according to the schematic shown below
