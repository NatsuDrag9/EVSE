# Frequency Controlled EVSE

This project implements a possible solution that monitors the power systemâ€™s frequency using Arduino MKR100. The application allows the electric vehicle owner (the user) to either opt for automatic charging or manually select the charing current remotely from a web application. The current charging the vehicle is controlled by the duty cycle of PWM signal generated by the microcontroller based on the IEC61851 standard.
